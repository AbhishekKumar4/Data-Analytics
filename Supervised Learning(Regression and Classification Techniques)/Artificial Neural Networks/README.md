# Artificial Neural Networks

- Inspired by biology.
- We have different neural network architechtures proposed for variety of analytics tasks. such as :
  - Regression.
  - Classification. (For now we will concentrate on classification only)
  - Clustering.
  - Feature extraction etc.
- There architechtures are netwrok of simple computing entities.
- Resurgance (increase) in interest recently.

# Biological Neural Network

- Looking into biological neural network, we will basically only focus on input and the output.
- Neuron receives input from dendrite or dendrite branches.
- and when input signal is above a certain threshold its going to produce an output that is going to be transmitted via tha synapsis to neurons that are further down the line.
