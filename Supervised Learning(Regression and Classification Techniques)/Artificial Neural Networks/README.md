- Inspired by biology.
- We have different neural network architechtures proposed for variety of analytics tasks. such as :
  - Regression.
  - Classification.
  - Clustering.
  - Feature extraction etc.
- There architechtures are netwrok of simple computing entities.
- Resurgance (increase) in interest recently.
