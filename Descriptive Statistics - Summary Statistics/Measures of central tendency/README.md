# Measures of Central Tendency
-	Fairly central value.
-	Take minimum value going all the way to maximum value and pick something that is in-between.
-	Another way is to see, where we are covering exactly 50% of area under the curve.
-	Think of it as a balance, as a seesaw. Where would you want to put the fulcrum such that this whole thing balances out.

# Three measures of central tendency
-	Mean
-	Median
-	Mode 
# Mean
The idea behind mean is just that it is the concept of average. i.e. sum of all the numbers divided by total number of numbers there are.

# Median
The median is calculated by arranging all the numbers in order (ascending or descending ), and choose the central number.
Choosing the central number is easy when you have an odd number of numbers, in case of even numbers when you have two central numbers, just take the average of two.

# Mode 
-	Mode is the most common number.
-	No number might repeat itself.
-	One big advantage is it can be used with nominal variables too.

# How do we choose between Mean and Median?
If you have to choose between mean and median, much of the debate usually comes down to the idea of **outliers**. 
# Outlier
It is the number or a value that is not really within that set of most of the other numbers, now this could be because of many reasons. This could be error in data so this is a bad outlier or outlier must not be an error and I tells important part of the story.
In really simple words,
**The median is not influenced much by the outliers, whereas the mean is greatly influenced by the outlier. For this reason median is often kind of expressed as a more robust metric to outliers.**

**Example**
A classic example where medians are used is when looking at salaries of the people, where the idea is that salaries having some sense of exponentials. Many people earn a consistent salary and then there are few people who just earn catastrophically high amounts. And here talking about the mean will not give us the typical salary that a person earns.
**Let’s look at another example where we would like to go with the mean.**
Let us say that we have this dataset where we were looking at particular financial strategy. In this financial strategy we are looking at how much money we made on a daily basis. So, this financial strategy made us lose 1 rupee everyday on 99 percent of the days, but on 1 percent this strategy gave us 10 crores, so a large enough number.
So if we love making money we would love this strategy because despite the fact we lost 1 rupee on 99 percent of the days as long as we can play this game we are bound to make good amount of money.
The median of this strategy would have been -1.
So in this case mean would be great measure to go by if we have to choose whether to play this strategy or not.

# When to use mode
Let’s take an example of multi modal distribution (many peeks). 
Let’s say that we looked into this 100 meter long street, where residents have to make a decision on where to place a trash can. So, we took the survey from  all the residents. In this survey 40% voted for garbage can to be placed at 25th meter mark, 45% voted for 75th meter mark and 15% uniform between 0-100 meter mark.
In this case, problem with mean and median is they might wind up saying that the average preference is to keep the trash can somewhere 50 or 52 meter mark, because this is bound ot be the central value. No, that might be something that nobody wanted whereas something like a mode would just categorically say keep it at 75th meter mark as this is most popular preference.
