# T-Test

- To make statement about population mean.
- When variance is unknown (In most of the real life cases we wont know the variance).
- For Small sample size.
- Only reason we are doping this test is when we dont know what the poplation mean is unlike z-test.

Special in t-test is DOF-Degrees of freedom it has DOF = N-1, T-distribution with DOF>=30 look exactly like N(0, 1square). The lower it becomes we can see it looks shorter than N(0, 1 square) and tails are fatter.
