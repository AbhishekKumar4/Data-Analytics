# Z-Test

Single sample z-test is a test that is used when we want to make some inferences about the population mean. Note that we are saying using the sample, but we are not interested in just reporting the sample mean, which is what we might we done with descriptive statistics; but, we are interested in ultimately making a statement about the population means. And, this is a test, where we need to know the variance or standard deviation.

**What are we testing?**
Population mean. We have a sample but with this sample we want to say something about the population mean.

**Useful when we know the standard deviation or variance.**

**When sample size is very large i.e >=30. When sample size is >=30 we have large enough sample that we can actually calculate the variance from the data and use it.**

Example: Average phosphate level in blood is <=4.8 mg/dl, with a known standard deviation of 0.4 mg/dl.
Data : 4.1, 3.9. 5.3, 4.7 ........

Now we have sample data, we need to say something about the population.

Steps:
Step 1: Check null hypothesis.

Step 2: Calculate the 'test statistics'.

Step 3: If the null hypothesis is true, than the z-statistic should be the same or equivalent to pulling a random number from a z-distribution or N(0, 1), with mean 0 and variance 1.
