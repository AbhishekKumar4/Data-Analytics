# Single Sample Tests

For situations when we are dealing with a single sample.

For Example:

1) Average phosphate levels in blood should be <= 4.8 mg/dl.
2) Health department only allows 5% of the toothpastes of each brand to be out of specification (ratio of flouride etc).
3) New garage is inflating repair costs for accidents. Insurance fraud is suspected.
