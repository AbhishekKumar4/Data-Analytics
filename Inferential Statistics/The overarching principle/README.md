# The overarching principle

- Have a null and alternate hypothesis.

- Do some basic calculations/arithmetic on the data to create a single number called the **Test Statistic**.

- If we assume the null hypothesis to be true (and make some assumptions about the distributions of various variables), then the test statistics should be no different than a single random draw from as specific probability distribution.

- Test the probability that the **test statistic** we calculated belongs to this theoretical distribution. **This is the p value.**
