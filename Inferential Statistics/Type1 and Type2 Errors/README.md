# Type-1
 - Prior to any data collection our type 1 error could be as high as alpha, and after analysis it is exactly equal to our p-value.
 
# Type-2
 - More complicated. why?
 - It is a function of delta.
 u1 =/(not equal) y2, because u1=u2+delta
 - It is a function of sample size.
 - It is a function of type-1 error.
 - The power of a test = 1 - Beta(bad thing).
 - It is a graph of beta(type-2 error) versus delta for a given sample size n and is also known as operational characterstic **OC**.
