# Inferential Statistics

- Inferential statistical analysis infers (concludes) properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population.

**OR**

- Inferential statistics takes data from a sample and makes inferences about the larger population from which the sample was drawn. Because the goal of inferential statistics is to draw conclusions from a sample and generalize them to a population, we need to have confidence that our sample accurately reflects the population. This requirement affects our process.

**OR**

- To make some inference about the population from a sample.

For Example : Average calcium level in blood should be < 5.8 mg/dl, some might have 5 or 6 but this is sample data.
The problem with this is if we take two or more data points maybe our average lie just below the range.

**As the number of samples tends to infinity it (sample average) converge towards population average.**

**The more data point we take, the overall variance of distribution reduces.

**For finite number of samples we will have different distributions.**

So, that is why we need to do something more, we need to do something more complex than just blindly taking the sample average.

In some cases, it might be brutally obvious, where every single data point is so high or so low, than you do not need a statistician to tell that the answer to this question. But, when it is not that case we need little more, we need inferential statistics to answer that question.

Standard analysis tools of inferential statistics:
The most common methodologies in inferential statistics are hypothesis tests, confidence intervals, and regression analysis.
