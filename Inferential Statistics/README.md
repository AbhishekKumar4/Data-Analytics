# Inferential Statistics

- Inferential statistical analysis infers (concludes) properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population.

**OR**

- Inferential statistics takes data from a sample and makes inferences about the larger population from which the sample was drawn. Because the goal of inferential statistics is to draw conclusions from a sample and generalize them to a population, we need to have confidence that our sample accurately reflects the population. This requirement affects our process.

**OR**

- To make some inference about the population from a sample.

For Example : Average calcium level in blood should be < 5.8 mg/dl, some might have 5 or 6 but this is sample data.
The problem with this is if we take two or more data points maybe our average lie just below the range.

**As the number of samples tends to infinity it (sample average) converge towards population average.
**For finite number of samples we will have different distributions.**
