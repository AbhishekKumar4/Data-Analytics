# Confidence Intervals

The conclusion of a statistical inference is a statistical proposition. Some common forms of statistical proposition are the following : 
 - Hypothesis
 - Estimation
 
- Estimation is point and interval( but mainly interval).
- We are usually interested in some population parameter for example : amount of phosphate in ib blood, average height of students. but we dont know it. What we have in hand is a sample from the population. In hypothesis testing we hypothesise with **estimation**. We dont have any hypothesis in mind. what we do is we take a sample and with point estimation, we try to come up with single point estimate of the population parameter.

For Example : Average amount of phosphate level in blood (population parameter).

- Simple point estimation could be our population mean (one of the best point estimate).
- It is different in terms of explicit hypothesis.
- If we take another sample our population mean might be different.

**So, we can come up with some range around this sample mean. essntially giving ourself a margin of error. So we are fairly certain that we have covered the population mean.**

- It is same underlying math when Ho:Uo=4.8;

- Given that we dont have some hypothesis. we ask ourselves the question that within what range can our U's be such that, we will calculate a 'Z' such that we will get a p-value which we will not reject.

# Different ways of conceptualizing

- If we were to repeatedly take identical samples (same size) and build similar confidence interval bounds for each sample than 95% of such CI bounds will cover the true mean.
- We are 95% confident/certain that the true mean is within our confidence interval.
