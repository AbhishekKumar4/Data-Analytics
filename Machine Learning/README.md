# Machine Learning

- Is trying to learn models about the process that generated the data from the data itself.
- Example : Rainfall follow a intermittent pattern over the season. Temprature is showing a linear growth.
- Machine learning is essential in predictive, descriptive and prescriptive analysis. Example : What will the temprature be in next 15 minutes?. Which areas are likely to receive rain?. Should we invest in this stock?.

**Prescriptive Analysis**
- What should we do in response to the patterns that we are discovering.

**Machine Learning Definition**

An agent said to learn from experience with respect to some class of tasks, and a performance with measure P, if (the learner's) performance at tasks in the class as measured by P, improves with experience. - Tom Mitchell, 1997.
