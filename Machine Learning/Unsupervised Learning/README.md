# Unsupervised Learning

- Till now we were working with labelled training data.
- In unsupervised learning we wil be working with unlabelled training data.
- Input data is going to look like points in n-dimensional space.

**What are we interested in doing here?**

- In the task of clustering we are interested to find groupings of similar data points in our input.

**Things to notice**
 - The clusters all seems to be ellipses.
 - There are few data points that do not belong to any of these clusters. Such points are called as outliers (very far away or doesnot lie in our pattern).
 
# Application's

- Customer data analysis
  - To discover classes of customers.
- Image pixels
  - Discover regions.
- Astronomical data analysis
  - Understanding galaxy formation
- Organize computing clusters
