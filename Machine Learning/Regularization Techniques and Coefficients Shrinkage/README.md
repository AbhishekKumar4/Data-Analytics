# Regularization Techniques and Coefficients Shrinkage

- How do we go about choosing our input variable? The problem of subset selection.
- Adjusted R(square) and coefficient shrinkage in continuation to subset selection in multiple regression.
- How do we measure, how good the model is?
- How to get good predictive accuracy, and its also useful for interpretation.
