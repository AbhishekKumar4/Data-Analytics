# Data and Algorithmic Modelling

# K Nearest neighbours techniques

- New supervised learning approach.
- By introducing this technique and comparing it to something we already know which is regression analysis.
- By doing this comparision we are hoping to illustrate or appreciate two very different styles of performing a supervised learning analysis and process of prediction itself.
- By this we learn that there are lots of other techniques too which takes inspiration from this approach.
- Breimen L (2001) said that statistical modelling is of two styles or two cultures.

# 1. Data Modelling Approach

- For example standard regression.
- Where we have some output variable Y and we envision this output variable as some function of our input.

Example: for linear regression Y = f(x) + E(Noise), for multiple regression and also with discriminant analysis etc.

- Alll captures functional relationships between y and x and that function is in some sense cast in stone and the only job we are left with is to go get the data and figure out what the parameters are of the function.
