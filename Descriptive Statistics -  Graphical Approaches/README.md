# Descriptive Statistics : Graphical Approaches

# Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics is the idea of quantitatively describing the data hrough various means. and we can do this through visualization techniques like graphical representations, tabular representations and through summary statistics.

Crunch the data --> work with the data --> come up with different numbers that summarize the data for us.

Descriptive statistics is a way to say something meaningful for the data that we have at hand and it does not allow us to make conclusions beyond the data that we have.

Descriptive statistics can be about single variables and multiple variables. and with multiple variables our topic of interest is relationships i.e how does one variable changes with respect to other.
