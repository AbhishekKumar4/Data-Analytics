# Bar Graphs
If one is dealing with single variable and lets say its categorical, a great way to represent it is bar graphs.

# Example
Ask people about their highest level of education and let the highest level of education be the variable. The possible values that it can takes up are high school, graduation and post graduation (This is a categorical variable).
Interesting thing to note here is that our categorical variable is nominal variable i.e there is an order from high school to post graduation. Even if we flip the whole thing around, we will still have the order in a sense that post graduation is more in years.

Good thing about bar graph is the concept of y-axis, this makes it very easy to represent ordinal variables which are categorical.
