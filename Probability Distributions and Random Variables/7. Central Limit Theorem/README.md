# Central Limit Theorem

- The sum(aggregation) of a sufficiently large number of independent random variables results in a random variable, which will be approximately normal.

**OR**

- The Central Limit Theorem states that the sampling distribution of the sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size gets larger — no matter what the shape of the population distribution. This fact holds especially true for sample sizes over 30. All this is saying is that as you take more samples, especially large ones, your graph of the sample means will look more like a normal distribution.

**OR**

- The central limit theorem (CLT) is one of the most important results in probability theory. It states that, under certain conditions, the sum of a large number of random variables is approximately normal.

As the sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the mean, X-bar, can be approximated by a normal distribution with mean µ and standard deviation σ/√n where:

µ is the population mean
σ is the population standard deviation
n is the sample size

# Central Limit Theorem Examples

A Central Limit Theorem word problem will most likely contain the phrase “assume the variable is normally distributed”, or one like it. With these central limit theorem examples, we will be given:


- A population (i.e. 29-year-old males, seniors between 72 and 76, all registered vehicles, all cat owners)
- An average (i.e. 125 pounds, 24 hours, 15 years, $15.74)
- A standard deviation (i.e. 14.4lbs, 3 hours, 120 months, $196.42)
- A sample size (i.e. 15 males, 10 seniors, 79 cars, 100 households)

and

- We want to find the probability that the mean is greater than a certain number
- We want to find the probability that the mean is less than a certain number
- We want to find the probability that the mean is between a certain set of numbers either side of the mean
