# Sampling Distribution

- Lets say that we have a original distribution and this distribution is normally distributed with mean 'mu'and standard deviation which can be represented by variance 'sigma square'.
- We took some more samples from the population and this time the sample mean may be or may not be equal to 'mu', it could be little greater or less than 'mu'.
- As we take more samples we will get new values. This means that we have a random variable and the random variable is the sample mean of the distribution of size 'N'.
- So, the core idea associated with sampling, which is from the original distribution, we take a sample and compute some mean and we get a certain value but the value itself belongs to the distribution and that distribution changes based on sample size.
-  When our original distribution is normally distributed the distribution of sample means is also normally distributed, but their might be some questions we have in this regard. So, for instance what is the shape of this distribution the quick answer to the question is when the original distribution is normal like we said, this distribution of sample means is also normal.
