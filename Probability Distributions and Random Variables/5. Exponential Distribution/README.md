# Exponential Distribution

- It is a continuous distribution.
- Inter arrival times of the poisson distribution **(like grometric is for binomial)**.
- Think of exponential as moving in time and wait for occurences.

Example: 
1) How long should we wait till the next person arrives or next head arrives.
2) How long do we need to wait until a customer enters our shop?
3) How long will a piece of machinery work without breaking down?
