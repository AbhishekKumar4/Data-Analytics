# Geometric Distribution

- The geometric distribution represents the number of failures before you get a success in a series of Bernoulli trials.
- Also a discrete distribution.
- Inter-arrival counterpart of binomial distribution.

Example : How many times do i need to toss the coinbefore i get my first head.

where,
n = number of events before success.

CMF = 1 - (1 - P) power n.
