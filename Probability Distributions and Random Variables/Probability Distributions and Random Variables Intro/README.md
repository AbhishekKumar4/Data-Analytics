# Probability Distributions and Random Variables

**Quick question is why do we need to talk about probability distributions. What does it have to do with data?**

<div style="text-align: justify;">
It is like a mathematical concept, if we look at the use of the histogram we express that as a way of describing data.</div>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>If we look at this picture above, the histogram is those vertical gray, grayish blue bars that you see on this graph and that describes the data that summarizes the data in some way. But if we collect a new sample we will get bars that looks slightly different and the question is, is it really coming from a probability distribution, is it coming from some other mathematical function that closely approximates this histogram that you are seeing. And that red line that you see on this is the attempt to fit this mathematical function.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>The core idea here is this data is being generated by this probability distribution function, which is that red line and the histogram is, what we see in terms of data. Because, not every time we going to get data that looks exactly like the red line, so it is in this context that we can think of a probability distribution also as a way of just describing our data. But, we would say describing and not summarizing, because it is fairly comprehensive, it just does not give us one number or one thing. It gives the full form and shape of that data and we can think of it as an exercise also in modeling our data.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>So, we are not just describing it, you modeling it. So, in that context probability distributions are very important and we will also see how in various other things, not just describing data, but even in terms of doing more advanced analytics in the machine learning parts in the statistical inference parts, the use of probability distributions is critical.</p>

<p style='text-align: justify;'>Think of a data set that has random numbers that are being generated in accordance to some mathematical function is the whole idea behind, the use of probability distributions with respect to data.</p>


# Random variables
Variable whose value is subject to variations due to randomness.The distinguishing factor between a variable and a random variable is that, with a regular variable once you fix all the externalities, then the variable takes on a specific value.

For example : F = m * a

Force can be any possible value, it can take on various numbers as it is value with some units. But, once you fix mass and you fix acceleration, force will take on a very specific value. **As oppose to a random variable**

and **The mathematical function describing this randomness is called probability distribution.**


**We can broadly break up the idea of probability distributions into discrete probability distributions in continuous distributions.**

 # Discrete probability distributions
Which is that the probability something happens is x. So, we might say the probability that rains today is 10 percent, What goes unsaid is that, there is therefore, a 90 percent chance that it does not rain today. Essentially we are talking about these kind of binary events, where one of the possible outcomes is x and therefore, by definition the remaining possible is just 1 minus x or if we are thinking of it in terms of percentage, then its 100 minus x.

Another very simple example of this could also be something like there is a 50 percent chance that, if we toss the coin we are going to get heads and what goes without saying is therefore, that there is a 50 percent chance that we would not get heads. In this case, that is called tails.

So, that is one very simple conception of probability and this is a probability distribution, it is called **Bernoulli distribution**, but we can move to multiple outcomes.
