# Poisson Distribution

- Also a discrete distribution.
- Similar to binomial as it also signifies the probability of 'x' occurances or a certain event BUT over a certain period of time or space.

For example :

1) What is the probability of 5 people coming to this bus stop over next 15 minutes.
2) Numbers of banks per kilometer.
3) Number of calls I made per month.

How many occurances happen over a certain period of time or space which is continuos.

where,
- k = 0, 1, 2, 3 ...
- Lambda ( λ) is Rate or Mean number of successes in the given time interval or region of space.
If 2 people arrive per minute.

**Special thing in poisson distribution is that mean and variance both are λ (and λ > 0).
