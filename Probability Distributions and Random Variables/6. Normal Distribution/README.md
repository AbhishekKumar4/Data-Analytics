# Normal Distribution

- The normal distribution is the most important probability distribution in statistics because it fits many natural phenomena.
- It is also known as the Gaussian distribution.
- Sometimes called the bell curve,  is a distribution that occurs naturally in many situations.
- The bell curve is symmetrical. Half of the data will fall to the left of the mean; half will fall to the right.

# Properties of a normal distribution
The mean, mode and median are all equal.The curve is symmetric at the center (i.e. around the mean, Î¼). Exactly half of the values are to the left of center and exactly half the values are to the right. The total area under the curve is 1.

However, **CDF is not something that simplifies very elegantly.** So, to define the CDF you would still use your traditional procedure of using the integral and by the way the normal distribution goes from minus infinity to plus infinity

So, the CDF is often just stored in tables, sometimes especially for the normal with mean 0, standard deviation 1 or it is just something that we integrate each time to get.
