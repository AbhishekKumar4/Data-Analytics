# Binomial Distribution
"Bi" means "two" (like a bicycle has two wheels), so this is about things with two results.

To understand binomial distribution more we first have to take a look at.
 
 1) Bernoulli process :  This process is based on sequences and binary level. Basically, Bernoulli process is an infinite or finite sequence of random variables that are of binary form that is they take just two values 0 or 1.
 
 2) Binomial Experiment : A binomial experiment is a statistical experiment that has the following properties -
- The experiment consists of n repeated trials.
- Each trial can result in just two possible outcomes. We call one of these outcomes a success and the other, a failure.
- The probability of success, denoted by P, is the same on every trial.
- The trials are independent; that is, the outcome on one trial does not affect the outcome on other trials.

Now, coming back to binomial distribution.

- A binomial random variable is the number of successes x in n repeated trials of a binomial experiment. The probability distribution of a binomial random variable is called a binomial distribution. Suppose we flip a coin two times and count the number of heads (successes).
- Taking part in a Bernoulli process.
- Getting K success out of N number of times.
- Example 5 defective products in a batch of 20, then what is the probability of 3 defective products and so on.

If we qualtify the probability of heads and tails than we are taking about Bernoulli. But instead if we rephrase the problem and say. what is the probability of getting 5 heads out of 10 tosses. Then we are dealing with the problem associated with Binomial Distribution.

**PDF (Probability density function)
or PMF (Probability mass function : PMF is a standard way of calling PDF, when we are dealing with discrete distributions.)**

to be read as n choose k, ex : 5 heads out of 10 tosses.
Here n = 10, and k=5.

 - Userful for small values of n.
 - Mean = np, and variance = np(1-p).
